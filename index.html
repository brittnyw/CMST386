            <h1>About Brittny</h1>
            <h2>General Information</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Brittny Woods. I am a Digital Media and Web Technology major, also minoring in Computer Science, at University of Maryland Global Campus. This is not my first online class. My computer experience stradles between intermediate and advanced. I completed CMST 385 in the fall of 2018.
            </p>
            <h2>Web Design Info</h2>
            <p>
                I do not currently work in web design. However, I am hoping that with the help of this class, I may being to expriment with freelance web design in the near future. I have intermediate experience writing in HTML and CSS, as well as Java and Python. Throughout this class, I plan to use Brackets as my text editor.
            </p>
            <h2>About My Computer</h2>
            <p>
               At home, I use a Mac Mini with a dual monitor setup.  As well as a iPad Pro for when I am on the go. At work, I use mostly Dell PC with Windows 7, and I will occasionaly complete my homework assignments there.
                
                Since I use both Mac and PC on a daily basis, I have experience using Windows 7, Windows 10, and Mac OS. I have also done some experimenting on Unbuntu, just get a feel for Linux. However, Linux is very similar to using Mac OS, especially when it comes to the terminal commands.
            </p>
            <h2>Additional Info.</h2>
            <p>
                Although I do consider myself experienced in using HTMl and CSS, I am still nervous (and excited) about learning more advanced web design concepts and programming with JavaScript commands.
