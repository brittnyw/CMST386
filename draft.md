    #### Response
    `This website will be created for the department I currently work for. I am in charge of the design and implementation of the website. I will be getting each phase of the website development approved by the VP of Collegewide Facilities and the Senior VP of Administrative and Fiscal Services. Phase one will begin with the initial proposal and mock-up of the site. Phase two will involve research and information gathering to narrow down on the content that the VP and SVP want to have included on the website. Phase three will involve asset design (images, graphics). The approvals for phase 3 will be less formal and more information to show that the project is staying on schedule. Phase four will involve the initial drafting of all HTML webpages and stylesheets. As the bulk of the information is added to each HTML page, the VP and SVP will review the pages to determine if they want to add or remove any items. Phase 5 will involve testing the website functions. Once everything has been tested and both the VP and SVP have approved, the site will be published.`

    #### Response
    `The testing for this website will verify that all links and content display and operate properly in multiple web browsers and mobile devices. I will test to see how the website operates in the four major browsers, Chrome, IE, Safari, and Firefox. I will also test to make sure the website is responsive on iOS and Android devices.`

Without knowing who is the target audience the designer will be hard-pressed to design well a website to meet the target audience needs.)

- What unique content created and/or written/designed by you (text, images, etc.) will the website offer?

    `Montgomery College is a community college serving the Montgomery County Community. It's Central Facilities office oversees the day-to-day maintenance of the campus facilities and grounds, as well as the architecture, design, and development of building renovations and new building construction at each campus.
    
    The online newsletter will serve as a means for regular communication and updates with the College community about all of the major construction happening at each campus. There will also be information about recently completed construction and progresses the department has accomplished to make each campus student and environmentally friendly. This newsletter will also serve as a way to introduce and recognize the department staff for their hard work.
    
    The intended audience for the website are the students, faculty, and staff of the College, as well as any other community members that may use any of the College’s facilities. This identification is important as it will mean that the layout will need to be usable and accessible for a very diverse community. The content will also need to be catered to users that do not have any prior knowledge with architecture, design, or facilities management.
    
    The unique content on the website will be provided from various units in the Central Faciltites Department. I will try to narrow down any broad deatails so the information is readible to anyone without any technical architectual knowledge. Majority of the content will be in the form of photos and text, with some video and animation where applicable. The content will be update monthly, with the exception of any critcal information that will need to be updated as needed (i.e. delays, closures, construction detours).`

    #### Response
    `As the website grows, more interactive features may be added to help engage users more into the content. As the developer, I will try to keep the layout of the site clean and simple to allow for easy updates and additional pages that may be necessary for the future. As content on the site is updated each month, I will re-test the website to ensure all links and assets are continuing to work properly. On a quarterly basis, site features will be reviewed to ensure they are up-to-date, and operate in all of the major browsers, as well as reviewing with the VP and SVP to discuss any new unique content or assets they may want to add. These quarterly updates will align with the academic calendar, with the biggest updates occurring prior to the yearly fall and spring semesters. As content begins to build over time, older content (5 or more years) will be archived.`

Be specific in your reasoning.

    #### Response
    `The content on this website will be for informational purposes only. There will be no e-commerce nor any content that would require users to submit any information. This website will be used to post any major construction updates and detours, as well as closure notices, so an SSL certificate will still be used to protect from any phishing or hacking.`
