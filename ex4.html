            <p>
                Accessibility is usability for people who interact with products differently. The design of a website should not hinder the experience for users who may have physical, auditory, or visual impairments. Making the web accessible benefits individuals, businesses, and society.<br><br>
                The tab order of a website should be logical for people using assistive technology. Users should be able to use the tab key to navigate through and activate interactive items in a logical order, left to right and top to bottom. Each interactive element should have a visible focus state. This is important because a user that is unable to use a mouse and could rely solely on keyboard commands to navigate a website.<br><br>
                The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) initiates the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) through partnerships with organizations around the world.<br><br>
                The W3C also develops the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), with the goal of providing a single shared standard for web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally. The WCAG explains how to make web content accessible to people with disabilities.<br><br>
                One of the WCAG 2.0 requirements requires that the foreground and background colors on a website have a 4:5:1 contrast ratio at Level AA and a 7:1 contrast ration at Level AAA. To ensure that your website adheres to this guideline, you can use and online color contrast analyzer to determine the ratio between any foreground or background color.</p>

            <p>
                User-Centered Design (UCD) is the process of designing a website’s or application’s user interface, from the perspective of how it will be understood and used by a human user. This enables a system to be designed in a way that supports its intended users’ existing beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors as they relate to the tasks that the system is being designed to support. 
                <br><br>
                Usability is a measure of the interactive user experience associated with the user interface of a website or software application. A user-friendly interface design is easy-to-learn, supports users’ tasks and goals efficiently and effectively, and is satisfyingly engaging to use. Usability depends on how well the functionality fits user needs, how well the flow through the application fits user tasks, and how well the response of the application fits user expectations.
                <br><br>
                Usability is important because it can mean the difference between the success or failure of a system. Lack of usability can affect the accuracy in task performance, reduce the productivity of the workforce,  and cost unnecessary time and effort.
